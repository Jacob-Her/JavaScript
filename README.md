Description
This event is an interactive workshop designed to help participants develop practical skills in Git, a powerful version control system used by developers worldwide. Whether you're new to Git or looking to reinforce your knowledge, this event will provide hands-on experience with essential Git concepts and workflows. 
Link to join by Zoom is at the end.

Interactive Learning:

Participants will actively engage in hands-on exercises, such as creating their own repositories, collaborating on shared projects, and practicing common Git workflows.  By the end of the session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of how Git works and how to integrate it into their development workflow effectively.

This event is perfect for beginners, students, and professionals looking to solidify their Git knowledge and apply it in real-world scenarios.

Please, if you wish to follow along:
1. Download and Install Git before the event:
Download Git for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Follow the installation instructions and ensure Git is added to your systemâ€™s PATH.
2. Create a GitHub Profile
If you donâ€™t already have an account, sign up at GitHub.
Familiarize yourself with the GitHub interface, as we will be using it throughout the event.
3. Authenticate Git with GitHub
You can authenticate Git with GitHub using SSH keys or a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Using SSH Keys (More Secure)
            GitHubâ€™s SSH setup guide.
Using a Personal Access Token (Easier) (For HTTPS Users)
If you prefer to authenticate using a PAT, follow these steps:

4. Verify Your Setup
Open a terminal or Git Bash and check Git installation with:
'git --version'
Confirm authentication:
For SSH: Run 'ssh -T git@github.com'
For PAT: curl -H "Authorization: token" YOUR_PAT_HERE https://api.github.com/user
Once youâ€™ve completed these steps, youâ€™ll be ready to follow along with the hands-on activities during the event! ðŸš€
